# 360 Tour Walkthrough Project

Welcome to the **360 Tour Walkthrough Project**, an innovative platform designed for immersive exploration of 360-degree scenes. This project is in active development and aims to combine cutting-edge technology with a seamless user experience.

## üéØ Project Goals

The primary goal of this project is to provide a platform for creating and navigating through 360-degree virtual tours, enriched with:

- **Interactive Information Bubbles**: Embed relevant content like text, images, or videos within the scenes.
- **Scene Transitions**: Navigate smoothly between scenes for a cohesive walkthrough experience.
- **Support for Advanced Models**: Expand functionality to include Gaussian Splat Models and 3D models in future iterations.

Inspired by platforms like **Kuula**, this project strives to deliver similar capabilities while introducing advanced features that push the boundaries of virtual walkthroughs.
